<h2>Typography</h2>

<h3>The typographic needs for the app were chosen based on a highly legible, simple, friendly approach. Line heights and sizes should be followed as closely as possible for achieving this intention.</h3> 

<h4>Typeface</h4>
<p>The web app should use Open Sans for the font. This is a sans-serif typeface which allows for a clean, easy, and organized flow for the text on the page. A humanist font, it was designed with an upright stress, open form. It is intended to be neutral and friendly in its appearance and has excellent readability across a variety or sizes and web platforms.</p>
<p>This typeface is easily accessed in Google fonts.</p>

<h4>Font Sizes</h4>
<p>The sizes of the fonts are important in maintaining a strong, clear hierarchy on the page. This will allow for easy readability for the user plus nice differentiation between sections.</p>
	<li>Main Header: 32px</li><br>
	<li>Page Subheaders: 24px</li><br>
	<li>Body Copy: 16px</li><br>

<h4>Font Weights</h4>
<p>The copy of the page should use the same font, Open Sans, throughout. Yet to achieve the desired hierarchy various font weights should be used. This will help define the different sections.</p>
	<li>Main Header: 800</li><br>
	<li>Page Subheaders: 400</li><br>
	<li>Body Copy: 200</li><br>
