<h2>Form Elements</h2>
<h3>Certain points of the app will call for some form of user input. The form elements of the page which provide for that can appear as modals or pages.</h3>


<h4>Text Input</h4>
<p>The input forms should appear with a the same color as the background, appearing as a border. Ideally, only Content Color should appear as background. Padding is 0.5em. The input forms in the modal should take up approximately 1/3 of the screen. On a page they may be a little larger. The input forms pictured below have a width of 17.25em.<p> 

	<div class="input-form">
		User Input
	</div>	

<p>Occasionally users will forget to input information or make an error before clicking the submit button. The effected input boxes should become hilighted with a 2px solid Primary Color (red) border. The input font should also become the Primary Color with a font weight of 800.<p> 

	<div class="error-form">
		User Error
	</div>
