<h2>Form Elements</h2>
<h3>Certain points of the app will call for some form of user input. The form elements of the page which provide for that can appear as modals or pages.</h3>


<h4>Text Input</h4>
<p>The input forms should appear with a the same color as the background, appearing as a border. Ideally, only Content Color should appear as background. Padding is 0.5em. The input forms in the modal should take up approximately 1/3 of the screen. On a page they may be a little larger. The input forms pictured below have a width of 17.25em.<p> 

	<div class="input-form">
		User Input
	</div>	

<p>Occasionally users will forget to input information or make an error before clicking the submit button. The effected input boxes should become hilighted with a 2px solid Primary Color (red) border. The input font should also become the Primary Color with a font weight of 800.<p> 

	<div class="error-form">
		User Error
	</div>	
	<br>

<h4>Modals</h4>
<p>Throughout the app, modals are used as the primary means of user input. This provides an easy way for visual recognization when certain elements need to be altered or created. Spacing of all input fields should be appropriate to the information the user will be inputing.</p>

	<nav>
		<div class="jquery-wrap1">
			<div class="toggle1">
			    Form Modal Example
			</div>
			<div class="arrow1">
				<i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
			</div>
		</div>	
	  	<div class="collapse-example1">
			<br>
			<img src="/Assets/FormModal.png" class="table-pic">
		</div> 
	</nav>
	<br>

<h4>Time Off Request</h4>
<p>All form elements are intended to be modals except for the time off requests, to be seen by the administrator. This is designed in order to simplify the process of requesting staff time off requests. This is the one form element intended to be a page. Individual requests are to be called out by the Card Color.</p>

	<nav>
		<div class="jquery-wrap1">
			<div class="toggle1">
			    Time Off Request Example
			</div>
			<div class="arrow3">
				<i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
			</div>
		</div>	
	  	<div class="grid-css">
			<br>
			<img src="/Assets/TimeOffRequestExample.png" class="table-pic">
		</div> 
	</nav>
	<br>
