<h2>Buttons and Links</h2>

<h3>There should be an abundance of clickable content throughout the app. There are certain styles to follow to ensure that these elements can be easily found and utilized by the user.</h3> 

<h4>Buttons</h4>
<p>The Buttons should be used in the app whenever the user wishes to submit content which they have decided to input. They should be easy to recognize and called out with colors and sizes. They should also follow uniform specifications to ensure a consistent flow throughout the site. Displayed buttons have a padding of 2em on the sides and 1em on the top and bottom. They have a width of 7em and a border radius of 2px.</p>
<p>Primary buttons are the main button featured in the app. They should be featured in the main content pages of the site.
		<div class="button-wrap">
			<a href="#" class="a-header">
				<div class="primary-button">BUTTON</div>
			</a>	
			<a href="#" class="a-header">
				<div class="primary-button-hover">HOVER</div>
			</a>		
		</div>	
<p>The secondary buttons should be used when there is a need for a button not featured on the main page and needs to better complement the secondary color of the site.</p> 		
		<div class="button-wrap">
			<a href="#" class="a-header">
				<div class="secondary-button">BUTTON</div>
			</a>
			<a href="#" class="a-header">	
				<div class="secondary-button-hover">HOVER</div>	
			</a>	
		</div>	

<h4>Links</h4>
<p>There should be a link whenever there is a need to link to an outside page. When on the main content pages, the link should be underlined and have a color which helps call it out. The font color of the link should match the font color of Page Subheaders.</p>
<p>
	<div class="a-link-example-wrap">	
		<a href="#" class="a-link">Example</a>
	</div>	
</p>
<p>A link on the sites navigation should match the font color of the header's title. It should not be underlined. These links would take someone to their profile or the schedule page.</p>
<p>
	<div class="header-example">
		<a href="#" class="a-header">Example</a>
	</div>	
</p>
