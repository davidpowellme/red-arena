<h2>Page Layout</h2>
<h3>The page should be laid out in a well-constructed and easy to navigate manner. The page should include a grid and be responsive.</h3>

<h4>Grid</h4>
<p>The grid provides an easy, organized, responsive site. The app should use a 12 column grid with a 2% gutter width.<p>

<br>
<p>The grid construction in SCSS should involve variables and mixins. The HTML should be constructed with rows and columns so that the grid operates well and with clear organization throughout the code.</p><br>


  <nav>
    <div class="jquery-wrap1">
      <div class="toggle1">
          Example Grid Code (SCSS)
      </div>
      <div class="arrow3">
        <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
      </div>
    </div>  
      <div class="grid-css">
        <br>
        <img src="/Assets/GRID-CSS.png" class="table-pic">
      </div> 
  </nav>

  <nav>
    <div class="jquery-wrap1">
      <div class="toggle1">
          Example Grid Code (HTML)
      </div>
      <div class="arrow4">
        <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
      </div>
    </div>  
      <div class="grid-html">
        <br>
        <img src="/Assets/CSS-HTML.png">
      </div> 
  </nav>
  <br>

<h4>Breakpoints</h4>
<p>The app should be responsive so that it is easily and clearly legible across many platforms. Breakpoints will be used to implement that responsivity. The breakpoints can be nested in each defined class in the SCSS.</p>
