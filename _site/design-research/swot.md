#SWOT Analysis
RED Arena seems to be an effective, altruistic nonprofit with satisfied clients. While their work appears to be of the highest quality, the organization could benefit from embracing technology. The internal scheduling and communication systems are ineffective, and their online presence is weak. While the demand for their service is high (a very good thing), RED Arena has clients on a waitlist and cannot meet the current demand for their services.
