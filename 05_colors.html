<h2>Colors</h2>
<h3>The color palette for the app was chosen in order to convey friendliness while maintaining the professional look of a company web page.</h3>

<h4>Primary Color</h4>
<p>It was important for the color red to be included in the app, given the company name. The red used conveys a warm, rich tone without being too hurtful on the eyes. It is to be used in the main header and for secondary buttons.</p>
